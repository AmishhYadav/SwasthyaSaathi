It spreads through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
Common in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of India.

Chills and sweating
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Muscle pain and fatigue
In severe cases: anemia, breathing difficulty, organ failure
Causes
Parasite: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. knowlesi
Transmission: bites from infected mosquitoes
Diagnosis
Blood smear microscopy (gold standard)
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for parasite antigens
Treatment
Depends on parasite species and severity.
First-line drugs: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).
Severe malaria: IV artesunate or quinine.
Supportive care: fluids, blood transfusion if needed.
Prevention
Use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)
Indoor residual spraying (IRS)
Preventive medications for travelers
Elimination of stagnant water sources
