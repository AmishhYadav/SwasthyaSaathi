Introduction
Dengue is a viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV 1–4).
Transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which bite during daytime.
Major outbreaks occur in monsoon/post-monsoon seasons in India.
Symptoms
Sudden high fever
Severe headache
Pain behind the eyes
Joint and muscle pain (“breakbone fever”)
Nausea and vomiting
Skin rash (appearing 2–5 days after fever)
Mild bleeding (nose/gums, easy bruising)
Severe Dengue (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever / Shock Syndrome)
Severe abdominal pain
Persistent vomiting
Rapid breathing
Bleeding gums/nose
Fatigue and restlessness
Organ failure → life-threatening if untreated
Causes
Virus: Dengue virus (flavivirus)
Vector: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes
Diagnosis
NS1 antigen test (early detection)
IgM/IgG antibody tests
PCR (in advanced labs)
Treatment
No specific antiviral treatment.
Supportive care: fluids, rest, paracetamol (avoid aspirin/ibuprofen → bleeding risk).
Severe cases need hospitalization (IV fluids, platelet monitoring).
Prevention
Eliminate mosquito breeding sites (clean water containers).
Personal protection: mosquito repellents, full-sleeved clothing.
Fogging during outbreaks.
Dengue vaccine available in some countries (not routine in India).
Myths vs Facts
❌ “Papaya leaf cures dengue” → No clinical proof.
❌ “Antibiotics cure dengue” → False (it’s a virus).
✅ “Hydration helps recovery” → True, fluids are critical.
Public Health Context (India)
India reports millions of dengue cases annually.
Major challenge: urban mosquito breeding due to poor water management.
Prevention relies heavily on community participation.
